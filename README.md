# **Assignment1_rt**
During this assignment, two nodes were implemented: 
- `ass1_node1`, based on the code written in `UI.cpp`, which spawns `turtle2` and makes the user interact with the two turtles, making them move the way the user wants;
- `ass1_node2`, based on the code written in `distance.cpp`, which works as a controller of the distance between the two turtles and makes them stop in case of collision with the wall of between themselves.

# **Requirements**

- **ROS**: Must be installed and properly configured on the system.
- **Turtlesim Package**: Must be installed in your ROS workspace.
